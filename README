Run make to build the executable
then run ./run.sh
You can modify the arguments in run.sh to trigger various implementations

to run pre-defined tests on all the input graphs in directory ./test_graphs

In the submitted version I have commented the correctness checking code as it takes a lot of time if run on all input files.
